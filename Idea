#This App allows users to predict their team scores and wins with their 
families and friends.A prize is connected to however predicts the correct score.
#Suggest way of income is a small deduction fee from the prize.
# App meant for android users since almost all kenyans use android powered phones.
This app is guarenteed success since kenyans have expressed interest in prediction of games 
and placing their money to it.But users have not been able to play along with this idea with friends and families.
This will bring more fun and predictions will be more social and genuine.
I suggest running a test to this project on Telegram.
Telegram platform allows developers to integrate their html games.
This games can be played in groups and personal chats.The scores for each member in a chat is posted and 
updated depending on members high score.
I think we can build a simple html page where telegram users predict the winning team (soccer) in their telegram chats.
Telegram has a high number of kenyan users.
I expect Joe to try playing some telegram games and see what am talking about.
And also read the telegram game API.We should build the test page and intergrate with telegram within days.
This test will help us know how kenyans will interact with our app.The telegram games go viral so fast for their easy sharing and group
plays.
After the test i expect we start developing the App idea.
Comment and tell me what you think.
